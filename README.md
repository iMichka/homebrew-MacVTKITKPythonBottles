VTK ITK SimpleITK Python Homebrew tap
=====================================

This page provided binaries (Homebrew bottles) of VTK, ITK and SimpleITK for OS X (10.8, 10.9 and 10.10).
ITK 4.8.0 will bring Python wrappings back to Mac, so that one can now install it directly from homebrew.

The formulas were removed from the project and this repository will be deleted once ITK 4.8.0 is out.
Bottles will be provided by homebrew anytime soon.
